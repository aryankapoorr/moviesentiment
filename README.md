# Movie Sentiment Analysis Project


## Website
For a live demonstration of the sentiment analysis tool, visit [Movie Sentiment Analyzer](https://moviesentiment.streamlit.app/).

## Project Description
As a self-proclaimed cinephile, I am always looking for ways to gather the public's concensus opinion on a movie before watching. All of the current major outlets (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, Metacritic, etc.) are decent options, but can be arbitrary with bias and varying scoring systems from person to person. Calculating the sentiment of text from a movie review can create a standardized system for understanding the concensus opinion of a movie.

## Project Notebook
Explore the [project notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cl29Xsxy2YjZUaXfmDyi_n9IytefdcLS?usp=sharing) for an in-depth understanding of the analysis and implementation:
